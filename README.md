A MERN app. Users can share images of places and can write a few lines about the places they went to. React has been used to design the front end due to its flexible nature of creating components. Used Node.js and Express.js for server side. Used NO SQL database -> MongoDB for storing the data. Deployed the frontend on Firebase and the Backend on Heroku.
